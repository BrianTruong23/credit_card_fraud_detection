## Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive exploration of Credit Card Fraud Detection, showcasing the effectiveness of different machine learning models and data balancing techniques. Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements.

- If computational resources are not a constraint, the Random Forest model on the original data performs exceptionally well without the need for data balancing.

- If you prefer a balanced improvement in precision and recall, consider using SMOTE with Logistic Regression or SMOTE with Random Forest.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out and contribute to the project. Together, we can enhance the robustness and accuracy of credit card fraud detection systems.
